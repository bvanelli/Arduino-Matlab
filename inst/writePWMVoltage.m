% @deftypefn  {Loadable Function} writePWMVoltage(@var{ard},@var{pin},@var{volt})
%
% Writes a PWM voltage to a specified pin. This does not verify that the pin
% is capable of PWM. If the pin's mode is not 'PWM', it is changed to that.
% The voltage is based on the maximum that the board is capable of.
%
% @var{ard} - Arduino class.@*
% @var{pin} - Desired pin.@*
% @var{volt} - Desired PWM voltage. Max is the board's voltage.
